## "The XRPL ledger: from theory to practice."

- The folder "fund_accounts" contains code written in node.js to fund accounts (perform payments) and to check XRPL accounts' balances.

Node modules library "ripple-lib" must be installed alongside this code in order to work properly.

- The folders "mainNetXRPL", "privateXRPL" and "testNetXRPL" include example config files to start ripple nodes on the respective networks.
